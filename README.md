The **tiotemp** R package is developed and supported by Mazama Science to simplify the presentation of environmental and/or time series data with interactive and responsive visualizations. The package is written with JavaScript (D3.js, Leaflet.js, and Plotly.js) in conjunction with the **htmlwidgets** package to provide the user with easy-to-use R-bindings. 
**tiotemp** was designed to accommodate working with Shiny applications, as well as and static HTML pages.
